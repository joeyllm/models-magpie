## Mistral Fine-Tuning for Australian Context

This repository contains code, configurations, and documentation for fine-tuning the [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/) language model on Australian-specific data. The goal is to adapt the base model to better understand and generate content relevant to the Australian context â€” including language, culture, institutions, and regional knowledge.

## Objectives

- Fine-tune the Mistral model on high-quality Australian datasets
- Improve performance on tasks with localised terminology, cultural references, and spelling conventions (e.g., "organise" vs. "organize")
- Evaluate downstream improvements in generation and comprehension on Australian-specific tasks
